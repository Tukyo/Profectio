**Introduction**
King Snapi was the first of the Ciraelians to evolve far enough to have hands and fingers.  These evolutions allowed the Ciraelians to build and grow as a society, no longer moving day to day, moment to moment without a grasp of physicality and the space around them.

They knew of their existence and the world, but did not have a way to interact with this world, Snapi changed this. King Snapi gave the Ciraelians the ability to build the kingdom and now resides on the Throne of Corrus in the city of Cordova. He is not just or kind, or mean or cruel, these concepts do not exist to the Ciaelians as they have no time nor need for these concepts in the vast empty space of Cirra. Presently, you see the results of this Profectiōnem. We should however, turn back time, so that we may know how this all began.

Before all this began, the universe was formless and without structure, needing no interaction or reaction from anything that existed within. Some still consider the creation of existence, form and matter to be the wrong decision made by Deaus, however it cannot be undone.

The last decision that Deaus made, was the creation of existence and when this route was chosen, Deaus was sacrificed, becoming the center of the universe, however a small portion of Deaus was saved. This piece would reside in the realm that was created. When this happened, that of Deaus which was sacrificed took the form of an everlasting black hole, known to the Ciraelians as "Inanis", from which all gravity is produced, and from which came the Five Figureheads and King Snapi. The figureheads were named as such: Maelynoch, Kratis, Wynona, Glorian, and Hyatti. 

As each one of the figureheads descended, matter extruded from Inanis and gave life, death and meaning to nothing. This Coherent Mess is the direct result of Deaus' sacrifice; an unexpected outcome of design, emerging from that which knows none. Of these emerging concepts, the first being life, was given to King Snapi and thus began the dawn of the Ciraelians; another mistake that was yet to be known.

King Snapi was created as a proxy for Deaus, the first profectio. Deaus had no way to interact with what had been created, doomed to an eternally distant void that was indeterminately close, yet also boundlessly distant from Cirra. King Snapi possessed a small essence of Deaus, enough to guide the figureheads through the vast reaches of space, to the place that would be called home, Cirra.

When the Figureheads and King Snapi descended to the newly formed land, there was a moment of reprise, before the Bulla Benne was created and life flowed endlessly. For this creation to come into fruition, a sacrafice was needed. This was the sole purpose of King Snapi, and why all Ciraelians have but a fraction of King Snapi's essence within. The version of the King that rules from the Throne of Corrus is but a shell of the descended King Snapi. Thankfully, the Figureheads are still intact and reside in proximity to the throne.

Unfortunately, the sacrifice made by the King, created yet another mess, one less coherent than the last. King Snapi's mess was unbeknownst to all which would exist, indeed, since it did not yet exist.

When looking at a clock, one does not divulge into the workings of the clock and how it produces time. The purpose of this gaze towards time is functional, and normally with the intent of, seeing what time it is. So please know that even though coherency can be found within the interworkings of all life, this coherency is but a design of the fundamental process that has been developed to perceive the entropy of the mistakes made by those deemed "holy" within this story.
